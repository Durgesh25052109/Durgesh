    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <h5>Hello, and welcome to my digital space! My name is Durgesh Upadhyay, and I’m excited to share a bit about myself with you. I’m currently a first-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science at Inderprastha Engineering College in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by the endless possibilities of technology and its power to transform the way we live, work, and connect. This passion has driven me to dive deep into the world of web development and coding, where every line of code opens up a new realm of creativity and innovation.

        My journey into the tech world is fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning. I thrive on exploring new technologies, developing engaging web applications, and staying updated with the latest trends in the digital space. Whether it's experimenting with cutting-edge frameworks or troubleshooting complex coding challenges, I am always eager to push my boundaries and expand my skill set. I believe that every project, no matter how small, is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I approach each one with a blend of enthusiasm and dedication.
        
        Beyond the screen, I have a deep passion for sports, especially cricket. The sport has not only taught me the value of teamwork and discipline but has also instilled in me the importance of persistence and strategy—qualities that seamlessly translate into my academic and professional pursuits. I enjoy the thrill of the game and take pride in my skills on the cricket field, which have helped me develop a well-rounded perspective on both life and technology.
        
        Currently residing in Noida Sector 11, Uttar Pradesh, I am fortunate to be in an environment that encourages both academic excellence and personal growth. Balancing my rigorous academic schedule with my interests in technology and sports has taught me the art of time management and the importance of staying versatile. As I continue on my educational journey, I am excited about the future and the countless opportunities that lie ahead in the world of tech.
        
        Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to sharing my experiences, projects, and insights as I navigate through this thrilling landscape of technology and innovation. Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something amazing together!<h5>
